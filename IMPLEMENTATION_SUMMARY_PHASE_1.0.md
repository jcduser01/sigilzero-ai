# PHASE 1.0 DETERMINISM GUARDRAILS - HONEST STATUS ASSESSMENT

⚠️ **CRITICAL STATUS UPDATE:** This document originally claimed "implementation complete" but that claim was inaccurate. The code implements 7 invariants at the code level, but automated verification currently covers only 5-6 of them. 

**See [STAGE_9_ACTUAL_STATUS.md](./STAGE_9_ACTUAL_STATUS.md) for the corrected, comprehensive assessment including:**
- What IS implemented in code (7 invariants) ✓
- What IS automated in verification (5-6 checks) ✓
- What IS NOT verified (code review assumptions, operational procedures) ✗
- Corrected Definition of Done (9 items, 4/9 complete) ✓
- Risk assessment and next steps

## What Was Implemented

Phase 1.0 Determinism code patterns have been implemented across the SIGIL.ZERO AI platform to enforce 7 NON-NEGOTIABLE invariants. However, automated verification of all 7 invariants is INCOMPLETE. Critical bugs in the verification framework were identified and fixed (hardcoded snapshot allowlists, incomplete chainable validation). Full production readiness requires additional testing.

---

## Core Deliverables

### 1. **New Core Module: `sigilzero/core/determinism.py`**
Comprehensive verification framework for determinism invariants:

- **`SnapshotValidator`** - Validates presence and byte-integrity of all required input snapshots
- **`DeterminismVerifier`** - Full 7-point determinism invariant verification
- **`replay_run_idempotent()`** - Confirms runs are replayable from filesystem snapshots alone

**Usage:**
```python
from sigilzero.core.determinism import DeterminismVerifier, SnapshotValidator

# Verify a run
valid, details = DeterminismVerifier.verify_run_determinism(run_dir)

# Check snapshots
snapshot_valid, errors = SnapshotValidator.validate_run_directory(run_dir)
hash_valid, errors = SnapshotValidator.validate_snapshot_hashes(run_dir)
```

### 2. **Updated Schema: `sigilzero/core/schemas.py`**
Fixed schema issues and added chainable pipeline support:

- ✓ Removed duplicate field definitions in `RunManifest`
- ✓ Added `ChainedStage` model for chain audit trails
- ✓ Added `ChainMetadata` model for pipeline composition
- ✓ Bumped schema version to 1.2.0 (Phase 8 compatible)
- ✓ Ensured `DoctrineReference.resolved_at` excluded from serialization

### 3. **Enhanced Pipeline: `phase0_brand_optimization.py`**
Fixed manifest bugs and implemented deterministic chaining:

- ✓ Proper doctrine snapshot handling (not stub JSON)
- ✓ BLOCKER 2 FIX: Prior artifact snapshot includes actual output file hashes
- ✓ Fixed manifest construction (removed redundant fields)
- ✓ Complete chain metadata for audit trail
- ✓ Import fix: `DoctrineLoader` → `get_doctrine_loader`

### 4. **Comprehensive Documentation**

**`docs/ARCHITECTURE_PHASE_1.0_DETERMINISM.md`** (500+ lines)
- Complete specification of all 7 invariants
- Implementation algorithms and code examples
- JSON snapshot schema with examples
- Verification procedures and test cases
- Operational runbooks

**`docs/ARCHITECT_REPORT_PHASE_1.0.md`** (400+ lines)
- Structural changes summary
- Determinism validation for all 7 invariants
- Governance alignment confirmation
- Backward compatibility analysis
- Filesystem authority confirmation
- Definition of Done checklist

### 5. **Verification Framework: `smoke_determinism.py`**
Enhanced smoke tests covering:

- Test 1: Identical inputs → same run_id
- Test 2: Snapshots present
- Test 3: Snapshot hashes valid
- Test 4: run_id derivation correct
- Test 5: inputs_hash derivation correct
- Test 6: job_id governance verified
- Test 7: Run replayable from snapshots
- Test 8: No wall-clock time in determinism
- Test 9-12: Atomic failure behavior, collision handling, legacy compatibility

## Critical Fixes Applied (Session 4)

During code review, critical bugs were identified and fixed:

**BUG 1: Hardcoded Snapshot Allowlist (CRITICAL)**
- **Issue:** `DeterminismVerifier` hardcoded list of expected snapshots `["brief", "context", "model_config", "doctrine", "prior_artifact"]` 
- **Impact:** Any Stage 7+ pipeline with additional snapshots (e.g., `prompt_template`) would have those snapshots ignored in verification, returning false "valid" status
- **Root Cause:** Copy-paste from Phase 0, not using manifest-declared snapshot set
- **Fix:** Changed to iterate `manifest.input_snapshots` directly with no filtering
- **Status:** ✓ FIXED in determinism.py

**BUG 2: Incomplete Chainable Validation (MEDIUM)**
- **Issue:** Verification checked if `prior_artifact.resolved.json` file existed, but NOT whether it contained required fields
- **Impact:** Malformed chainable snapshots could pass validation unseen, violating "no silent drift" invariant
- **Fix:** Added explicit check for `prior_run_id`, `prior_output_hashes`, `required_outputs` in prior_artifact structure
- **Status:** ✓ FIXED in determinism.py

**BUG 3: Documentation Overclaimed Verification (INTEGRITY)**
- **Issue:** Claims "7-point determinism verification" but only 5 checks are truly automated; Doctrine governance and backward compatibility require code review
- **Impact:** False confidence in verification scope
- **Fix:** Added "CRITICAL CLARIFICATION" section in ARCHITECT_REPORT_PHASE_1.0.md distinguishing automated checks vs. assumptions
- **Status:** ✓ FIXED in documentation

## The 7 Invariants - Code Pattern Enforcement

### ✓ Invariant 1: Canonical Input Snapshots
All inputs written to disk BEFORE processing:
```
artifacts/<job_id>/<run_id>/inputs/
├── brief.resolved.json
├── context.resolved.json  
├── model_config.json
├── doctrine.resolved.json
└── prior_artifact.resolved.json (chainable only)
```

### ✓ Invariant 2: Deterministic run_id
- Derived ONLY from `inputs_hash`
- No randomness or timestamps
- Formula: `run_id = inputs_hash[:32]` (first 128 bits)
- Idempotent replay automatic

### ✓ Invariant 3: Governance-Level job_id
- Source: `brief.job_id` (immutable)
- Directory structure: `artifacts/<job_id>/<run_id>/`
- Separate: `queue_job_id` (ephemeral RQ UUID)

### ✓ Invariant 4: Doctrine as Hashed Input
- Versioned in-repo: `sigilzero/prompts/<id>/<version>/template.md`
- Path-safe: No traversal, no absolutes
- Hashed: Participates in inputs_hash
- Recorded: doctrine_id + version + sha256 in manifest

### ✓ Invariant 5: Filesystem Authoritative
- `artifacts/<job_id>/<run_id>/manifest.json` is source of truth
- Database is index-only (monitoring/search)
- Reindex capability: `python scripts/reindex_artifacts.py`
- System works without database

### ✓ Invariant 6: No Silent Drift
- Brief changes → inputs_hash changes → run_id changes
- Context changes → inputs_hash changes → run_id changes
- Doctrine changes → inputs_hash changes → run_id changes
- Chainable: Prior artifact changes → run_id changes
- No masking or suppression

### ✓ Invariant 7: Backward Compatibility
- `/jobs/run` API contract unchanged
- Artifact structure additions only (no breaking changes)
- Brief snapshot excludes Stage 5/6 fields only if defaults + not explicit
- Legacy symlinks supported: `artifacts/runs/<run_id>` → canonical path
- Old manifests still readable (schema evolution non-breaking)

## Key Technical Achievements

### Snapshot Format (Canonical JSON)
```python
# All snapshots use stable serialization:
json.dumps(data, sort_keys=True, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2)
# With trailing newline enforced
# Result: Byte-stable hashing independent of pretty-printer
```

### Determinism Chain
```
Snapshot Files (on disk)
    ↓ hash each file bytes
Snapshot Hashes {brief: sha256:..., context: sha256:..., ...}
    ↓ compute_inputs_hash() with alphabetical key order
inputs_hash = sha256:...
    ↓ derive_run_id() take first 32 hex chars
run_id = d79bbc34291a40a4b0f6faa67e10fc2a
    ↓ canonical directory
artifacts/ig-test-001/d79bbc34291a40a4b0f6faa67e10fc2a/
```

### Invariant Verification
```python
# Reconstive and verify:
1. Recompute inputs_hash from snapshot hashes → must match manifest
2. Recompute run_id from inputs_hash → must match manifest run_id
3. Load brief.json → job_id must match manifest job_id
4. Check genesis: manifest timestamps excluded from determinism
5. Validate chain: prior_artifact snapshot hash correct
```

## Testing & Validation

### How to Verify

**Run full smoke test suite:**
```bash
cd /path/to/sigilzero-ai
python app/scripts/smoke_determinism.py /app
```

**Verify specific run:**
```python
from pathlib import Path
from sigilzero.core.determinism import DeterminismVerifier

run_dir = Path("/app/artifacts/ig-test-001/d79bbc34291a40a4b0f6faa67e10fc2a")
is_valid, details = DeterminismVerifier.verify_run_determinism(run_dir)
print(f"Valid: {is_valid}")
for check_name, check_result in details["checks"].items():
    print(f"  {check_name}: {'✓' if check_result['valid'] else '✗'}")
```

**Check snapshot hashes:**
```python
from sigilzero.core.determinism import SnapshotValidator

valid, errors = SnapshotValidator.validate_snapshot_hashes(run_dir)
if not valid:
    for error in errors:
        print(f"  ERROR: {error}")
```

## What Must Be Done Before Production

See [STAGE_9_ACTUAL_STATUS.md](./STAGE_9_ACTUAL_STATUS.md) for complete checklist:

1. **Run verification suite on existing artifacts** - Validates framework correctness
2. **Execute code review checklist** - Doctrine whitelist, path safety, field handling  
3. **Operational testing** - Reindex, symlinks, DB-independent operation
4. **Integration testing** - Backward compatibility, schema evolution
5. **Staging deployment** - Real-world validation before production

**Current Status:** Code is ready for testing. Testing is NOT DONE.

**Status: NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION** (see checklist above — operational and integration testing incomplete)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Run verification suite:** `python app/scripts/smoke_determinism.py /app`
2. **Review documentation:** [ARCHITECTURE_PHASE_1.0_DETERMINISM.md](./docs/ARCHITECTURE_PHASE_1.0_DETERMINISM.md)
3. **Validate existing artifacts:** Use `DeterminismVerifier` on production runs
4. **Monitor in production:** Track inputs_hash changes and status field
5. **Operational procedure:** See [ARCHITECT_REPORT_PHASE_1.0.md](./docs/ARCHITECT_REPORT_PHASE_1.0.md)
