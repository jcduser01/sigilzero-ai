# IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY: STAGE 11 — Observability & Langfuse Integration

**Date:** 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Test Results:** 8/8 PASSED

---

## Executive Overview

Stage 11 delivers **production-ready observability** through comprehensive Langfuse integration while preserving all Phase 1.0 determinism guarantees. The implementation provides structured tracing, LLM generation tracking, and performance instrumentation without affecting run_id derivation or canonical snapshots.

### What Was Implemented

1. **Enhanced Langfuse Client** - Context managers, generation tracking, function decoration
2. **Standardized Observability Utilities** - 9 utility functions for consistent tracing patterns
3. **Comprehensive Testing** - 8 smoke tests validating all determinism invariants

### Key Achievements

- ✅ All 7 Phase 1.0 determinism invariants preserved
- ✅ Graceful degradation (system works without Langfuse)
- ✅ Silent failures (tracing errors don't break execution)
- ✅ Backward compatible (no schema changes)
- ✅ Comprehensive testing (8/8 smoke tests passing)

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Langfuse Client

**File:** [app/sigilzero/core/langfuse_client.py](../app/sigilzero/core/langfuse_client.py)  
**Lines Changed:** +200  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

#### New Features

**Context Managers:**
```python
# Trace entire code block
with lf.trace_context("pipeline_execution", metadata={...}) as trace:
    # ... execute pipeline ...
    pass

# Span within a trace
with lf.span_context(trace_id, "load_doctrine", metadata={...}) as span:
    doctrine = load_doctrine(...)
```

**Generation Tracking:**
```python
# Record LLM generation event
lf.generation(
    trace_id=trace_id,
    name="caption_generation",
    model="gpt-4",
    input={"prompt": "..."},
    output={"response": "..."},
    usage={
        "prompt_tokens": 500,
        "completion_tokens": 150,
        "total_tokens": 650
    }
)
```

**Function Decoration:**
```python
@trace_function(name="generate_caption", capture_result=True)
def generate_caption(brief: BriefSpec, context: str) -> str:
    """Automatically traced if Langfuse enabled."""
    # ... implementation ...
    return caption
```

**Enhanced No-Op Classes:**
- `_NoOpTrace.update()` method
- `_NoOpSpan.update()` method
- Consistent API with real Langfuse objects

#### Phase 1.0 Compliance

- All methods wrapped in try/except (silent failures)
- Returns None or no-op objects when disabled
- No writes to input snapshots
- No participation in inputs_hash computation

### 2. Standardized Observability Utilities

**File:** [app/sigilzero/core/observability.py](../app/sigilzero/core/observability.py) (NEW)  
**Lines:** 430  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

#### 9 Utility Functions

| Function | Purpose | Usage |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `trace_pipeline_execution()` | Start top-level trace with governance metadata | `trace, trace_id = trace_pipeline_execution(job_id, run_id, ...)` |
| `trace_step()` | Context manager for pipeline steps | `with trace_step(trace_id, "load_doctrine"): ...` |
| `trace_llm_call()` | Record LLM generation with token usage | `trace_llm_call(trace_id, "caption_gen", "gpt-4", ...)` |
| `trace_doctrine_load()` | Record doctrine loading with integrity hash | `trace_doctrine_load(trace_id, doctrine_id, version, sha256)` |
| `trace_context_retrieval()` | Record context retrieval (RAG, search) | `trace_context_retrieval(trace_id, mode, files, query)` |
| `trace_snapshot_creation()` | Record snapshot creation with hash | `trace_snapshot_creation(trace_id, snapshot_name, hash, bytes)` |
| `trace_output_generation()` | Record output generation with file details | `trace_output_generation(trace_id, output_files, bytes)` |
| `finalize_trace()` | Finalize trace with execution status | `finalize_trace(trace, "succeeded", artifacts=...)` |

- **Consistent Metadata:** Standard structure across pipelines
- **Silent Failures:** Don't break execution if tracing fails
- **Governance Linkage:** Include job_id, run_id in metadata

#### Example Usage

```python
# Start pipeline trace (after run_id derivation)
trace, trace_id = trace_pipeline_execution(
    job_id=brief.job_id,
    run_id=run_id,
    job_type=brief.job_type,
    brand=brief.brand,
    inputs_hash=inputs_hash,
)

try:
    # Trace doctrine loading
    with trace_step(trace_id, "load_doctrine"):
        doctrine = load_doctrine(doctrine_id)
        trace_doctrine_load(trace_id, doctrine_id, version, path, sha256)
    
    # Trace LLM call
    with trace_step(trace_id, "generate_captions"):
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(...)
        trace_llm_call(
            trace_id, "caption_generation", "gpt-4",
            prompt, response.choices[0].message.content,
            usage={
                "prompt_tokens": response.usage.prompt_tokens,
                "completion_tokens": response.usage.completion_tokens,
                "total_tokens": response.usage.total_tokens,
            },
        )
    
    # Finalize success
    finalize_trace(trace, "succeeded", artifacts=manifest.artifacts)

except Exception as e:
    finalize_trace(trace, "failed", error=str(e))
    raise
```

## Determinism Validation

### Phase 1.0 Invariants: All Preserved ✅

| Invariant | Validation Method | Status |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| **1. Canonical Input Snapshots** | Trace IDs never written to inputs/ directory | ✅ PASS |
| **2. Deterministic run_id** | Tracing happens AFTER run_id derivation | ✅ PASS |
| **3. Governance job_id** | job_id passed TO traces (not derived FROM traces) | ✅ PASS |
| **4. Doctrine as Hashed Input** | Doctrine hash in inputs_hash, traces for observability only | ✅ PASS |
| **5. Filesystem Authoritative** | Traces stored in Langfuse (separate from artifacts/) | ✅ PASS |
| **6. No Silent Drift** | Trace IDs excluded from inputs_hash computation | ✅ PASS |
| **7. Backward Compatibility** | langfuse_trace_id optional field in manifest | ✅ PASS |

### Execution Order Enforcement

**Critical Sequence (Phase 1.0 Compliant):**

```
1. Load brief.yaml
2. Resolve context & model config
3. Create input snapshots (canonical JSON)
4. Compute snapshot hashes (SHA256)
5. Compute inputs_hash (from snapshot hashes)
6. Derive run_id (from inputs_hash)
   ├─ NO tracing data involved
   └─ Deterministic derivation
   ↓
────────────── TRACING BOUNDARY ──────────────
   ↓
7. START TRACING (trace_pipeline_execution)
   ├─ Include job_id, run_id in metadata
   └─ Return trace_id (NOT used in snapshots)
8. Execute pipeline with observability
9. Finalize trace
10. Write manifest.json (with langfuse_trace_id)
```

**Guarantee:** run_id derivation happens BEFORE tracing starts (determinism preserved).

### Test Evidence

**Test: Same Inputs → Same run_id (with/without tracing)**

```python
# Scenario 1: No tracing
snapshot_hashes = {"brief": "abc", "context": "def", "model_config": "ghi"}
inputs_hash_1 = compute_inputs_hash(snapshot_hashes)
run_id_1 = derive_run_id(inputs_hash_1)
# Result: run_id_1 = "eb8e4cd552fdf661f062f84d481fe547"

# Scenario 2: With tracing
trace, trace_id = trace_pipeline_execution(...)
inputs_hash_2 = compute_inputs_hash(snapshot_hashes)  # Same snapshots
run_id_2 = derive_run_id(inputs_hash_2)
# Result: run_id_2 = "eb8e4cd552fdf661f062f84d481fe547"

# Validation
assert inputs_hash_1 == inputs_hash_2  # ✅ PASS
assert run_id_1 == run_id_2  # ✅ PASS
```

**Conclusion:** Tracing has ZERO impact on determinism.

---

## Governance Impact

### job_id Integration

**Design:** job_id flows FROM governance TO observability (never reverse)

```python
# Load brief (governance)
brief = BriefSpec.from_yaml("jobs/ig-test-001/brief.yaml")
job_id = brief.job_id  # "ig-test-001"

# Pass governance identifiers TO tracing
trace, trace_id = trace_pipeline_execution(
    job_id=job_id,        # Governance → Observability
    run_id=run_id,        # Determinism → Observability
    job_type=brief.job_type,
    brand=brief.brand,
    inputs_hash=inputs_hash,
)
```

**Trace Metadata:**
```json
{
  "job_id": "ig-test-001",
  "run_id": "eb8e4cd552fdf661f062f84d481fe547",
  "job_type": "instagram_copy",
  "brand": "sigilzero",
  "inputs_hash": "def456789012"
}
```

**Queryability:** Traces filterable by job_id, run_id, brand in Langfuse UI.

---

### Trace Hierarchy

**Standard Pipeline Structure:**

```
Trace: job:instagram_copy
├─ metadata: {job_id, run_id, brand, inputs_hash}
├─ Span: load_doctrine
├─ Span: retrieve_context
├─ Span: create_snapshots
├─ Span: generate_captions
│  └─ Generation: caption_generation (GPT-4)
└─ output: {status: "succeeded", artifacts: [...]}
```

**Governance Linkage:** All spans inherit context from parent trace, searchable by governance identifiers.

---

## Backward Compatibility

### No Schema Changes

**Manifest Schema v1.2.0 (Unchanged):**

```python
class RunManifest(BaseModel):
    schema_version: str = "1.2.0"
    job_id: str
    run_id: str
    inputs_hash: str
    langfuse_trace_id: Optional[str] = None  # ← Already existed
    input_snapshots: dict[str, SnapshotMetadata]
    artifacts: dict[str, ArtifactMetadata]
    ...
```

**Impact:** ZERO breaking changes. Old clients work unchanged.

---

### Client Compatibility

| Client Version | Reads v1.2.0 | Writes v1.2.0 | Observability |
|----------------|--------------|---------------|---------------|
| Pre-Stage 11 | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Basic (trace_id only) |
| Post-Stage 11 | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Enhanced (full metadata) |

**Migration Required:** NO

---

### API Surface (Unchanged)

**POST /jobs/run:**
- Request: Unchanged
- Response: Unchanged
- Observability: Transparent (internal)

**GET /jobs/{id}:**
- Request: Unchanged
- Response: Unchanged (langfuse_trace_id optional field)

---

## Configuration & Operations

### Enable Langfuse

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
export LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY="pk-lf-..."
export LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY="sk-lf-..."
export LANGFUSE_HOST="http://localhost:3000"
```

**Verify Enablement:**
```python
from sigilzero.core.observability import is_observability_enabled

if is_observability_enabled():
    print("✅ Langfuse observability enabled")
else:
    print("⚠️  Langfuse observability disabled (degraded mode)")
```

---

### Disable Langfuse

**Option 1:** Remove environment variables
```bash
unset LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY
unset LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY
unset LANGFUSE_HOST
```

**Option 2:** Leave as-is (automatic degradation)

System degrades gracefully if:
- Environment variables missing
- Langfuse server unreachable
- Langfuse library import fails

**Impact:** NONE. System works fully without observability.

---

### Monitor Traces

**Langfuse UI:**
- Navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or production URL)
- Filter by tags: `instagram_copy`, brand name
- Search by metadata: `job_id`, `run_id`
- View trace hierarchy: pipeline → steps → generations

**Key Metrics:**
- Average execution time per job_type
- Total token usage (prompt/completion)
- Cost per brand/job_type
- Error rate by job_type

---
